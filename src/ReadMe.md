# Data-Structures
Data Structures are critical for implementing efficient solutions using programming languages. Here, I have shared my version of the DS implementations.These are inspired from William Fisset. 

# Algorithms
Algorithms are instances of logic to approach a problem and work towards an effective solution. Here, I have shared the algorithms and techniques of approach learnt from leetcode problems.
